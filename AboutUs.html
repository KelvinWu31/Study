            <p class="p1">“China has telescoped into one generation what other countries took centuries to achieve. No country (let alone one of continental proportions) has tried to accomplish so much in such a short time.
                 China’s unique attempt to complete two transitions at once –from a command to a market economy and from a rural to an urban society—is without historical precedent.”</p>

            <p class="p1">The trip to China had three components: art, history and culture. We were exposed to traditional arts such as silk embroidery painting, cloisonné, jade sculpture and jewelry craft, the making of silk fabrics and clothing, lacquer ware. We visited factories and showrooms where these processes were explained and exhibited. The history component consisted of visits to historical monuments such as The Forbidden City, Tian'anmen Square, the remains of Chairman Mao, the site of the Nanjing Massacre. Through visiting these sites we came to understand certain facts about Chinese history.</p>
            <p class="p1">One example of this is the surprising discovery that many people revere Chairman Mao, founder of the Chinese Communist Party because he restored the nation's dignity by making China a military power and preventing foreign invasions. The cultural component consisted of learning about the Chinese way of eating - using chopsticks, eating communally and the diverse types of food eaten. We also visited many gardens wherein the Yin and Yang principle of Chinese culture is seen. Many gardens are composed of "hard" rock formations contrasted against the "softness" of water - via lakes, streams and ponds.</p>
            <p class="p1">Through comparative analysis of New York vs the Chinese cities that were visited, Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai, I came to understand the differences between city life in the U.S. and city life in China . One major difference is that streets accommodate bicycles, motor bikes and scooters. These vehicles are licensed and considered a part of pedestrian traffic. They are used by professionals as well as non-professionals to get to work. As a result of this type of daily exercise as well as public dancing and exercise, the Chinese are much thinner and obesity is rare.</p>
            <p class="p1">Overall, the trip was educational and informative. The accommodations were very good and the food was plentiful and healthy.</p>

            <p class="p4">My study abroad trip to China was a very rich experience for me. Growing up in New York, I had always assumed and taken for granted that China would be very similar to Chinatown. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a country full of beautiful and friendly people, rapidly developing cities, amazing architecture, peaceful gardens, and a tasty cuisine that varies from region to region. The most memorable part of the trip was interacting with the Chinese people. While there was a language barrier in many of the situations, the people were eager to help and often went above and beyond to make sure that needs were met. People were consistently patient with me, despite how fast-paced the culture is. I am already looking forward to making another trip to China so that I can continue to explore what China has to offer.</p>
            <p class="p4">I have also made many new friends on this trip. Since we were such a large and diverse group of students, I learned not only about the richness and diversity of Chinese culture, but also about the different cultural backgrounds of the students who I was traveling with. I will never forget how much I have learned from them and the wonderful times we had together.</p>

            <p class="p5">The Brooklyn College/CUNY trip to China 2005 was more than just a study abroad program it was a study of myself. By learning the Chinese culture and learning about the cultures of my ethnically diverse fellow trip mates I was led to deeper assess my own cultural identity. The trip consisted of forty-eight beautiful students from many different races, cultures and ethnicity and while studying China I was also learning about India, Africa, Dominican Republic, the Caribbean and all the other wonderful places that my trip mates were from.</p>
            <p class="p5">On this trip to China I decided on what I wanted to study in graduate school. Before this study abroad trip I didn’t even know if I wanted to go to graduate school but after visiting sites such as the Nanjing Massacre Museum I decided that I wanted to study Africana Studies in Graduate school and eventually work on creating a memorial for slavery in America . I have returned to America with new eyes and a wealth of knowledge that I could not have gained in a classroom.</p>
            <p class="p4">Visiting China and learning about their ancient secluded culture made me wonder what Africa would be like if the slave trade didn’t interrupt the African civilization. Africans across the Diaspora are disenfranchised and marginalized in cultures that they are forced to assimilate into and as a result our heritage and history have been distorted. Overall I believe that it is my duty or rather the duty of peoples of African decent to heal the mother continent by investigating their past and teaching the younger generation the truth.</p>
            <p class="p4">I have been encouraging all my friends to take a study abroad trip or better yet take the trip to China . I have become more cognizant of intercultural communication and the societal norms that govern and affect communication, not just through reading a textbook but also through living the ideas discussed in the textbooks and later forming my own conclusions.</p>
            <p class="p4">I have gained forty-six new friends and I have met a professor whose professionalism and passion for learning has left a lasting impression on me. Although I have learned a lot from this trip I am yet to overcome my biggest obstacle, learning to use the chopsticks.</p>
            <p class="p4">Thank you Professor Lu. You are wonderful!</p>
