# Brooklyn College's Study in China Website

## Overview: 

The site is built for the Brooklyn College's Communications Department of Studying abroad in China. I revamped the whole site from scratch by infusing minimialistic design in the site. 
The whole site is written in html and uses CSS for the front end, other things used include BootStrap.
